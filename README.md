you probably won't have to recompile stuff, but then again i suck at remembering to do it before commits.

honestly, if you're using this and you find that it doesn't suck too much and you have some ideas on how to make it better, i'd love to hear about it.


## why

because i couldn't find anything being actively developed that does this - and the stuff that was ~1 year stale still sucked balls.
